Unlike other **liquid staking projects**, Lumina utilizes liquid staking combined with bridge. This enables stakers to make their assets yield bearing. Also, it exposes cross-chain opportunity to benefit from providing liquidity to new chains or lend or borrow in new markets. Lumina's stakes serve to secure the infrastructure.

Unlike other **bridges**, Lumina has a failsafe layer with [augmentation](design/augmented-assets/). It protects stakers from hacking original asset with the other wrapped bridge assets.&#x20;
