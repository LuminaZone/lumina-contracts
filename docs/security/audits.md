# Audits

Lumina's security audit is unique from other crypto projects. The team witnessed audit firms' mistakes on mixing reports with other projects, misleading security vulnerability exposure due to lack of understanding of the code, and unnecessary overpriced guidance. As a result, Lumina dev team mainly trusts its test codes to defend in every layer of its code, and asks professional pen-testers to break them. This way, more security vulnerabilities can be effectively found, and it gives full understanding of the code to pen-testers. Here is the current partner for technical audits.

## Zellic

Zellic is professional in penetration test. They assume an attacker mindset when approaching the project's code. That includes attack surface enumeration, static analysis, manual review, and dynamic analysis. This matched our intention to protect the project. They break stuffs early before it is deployed in public.&#x20;

Notable achievements are that they are experts in cross-chain infrastructure, working closely with bridges like LayerZero, Wormhole, Succinct Labs, and more. Our commitment to bridge security extends to governance support; we are a member of Uniswap's Bridge Assessment Committee.
