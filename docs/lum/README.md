$LUM tells a story about omnichain experience of new disruptive, liberal, and democratic finance led by innovators in digital finance. It is a token to select assets to connect, power its omnichain infrastructure across blockchains.

$LUM commoditizes trust. Banks sell trust that money in an account is safe until they go bankrupt within its nation. Bitcoin sells trust that your wealth is safe with $BTC in oneâ€™s private key until the network stops or become unsustainable regardless of borders. $LUM sells trust that your smart contract account to put digital assets are safe until all its supporting networks become unsustainable or flawed.
