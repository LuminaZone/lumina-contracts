# âœ¨ Lumina

Lumina is the first Byzantine Fault Tolerant bridge to augment assets across blockchains with fail-safe mechanism with **liquid staking derivatives(LSD)**. It is the smart contract protocol to pass not only assets, but also any messages or transactions to execute remotely for intents.

## Features

### **No more wrapping.**

Stake your native coins or ERC20 tokens to augment into Lum assets, transfer to any network across blockchains.

Expand exposure to capital without permissioned bridges, and get $LUM as staking reward for keeping decentralized bridge.

Don't lose assets you staked, lose points for $LUM rewards. You can always claim back your original asset with no worries in your personal account.
